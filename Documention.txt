* OpenWeatherMap API: Retrieves weather information based on user input.

Installation-
1.Clone the repository from GitHub using Git Bash or download the ZIP file.
2.Navigate to the project directory  in your preferred code editor.
3.Open "index.html" in a browser to access the Weather App.
4.To use the application, you will need to obtain a free API key from OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api).

Configuration
To use the Weather App with your OpenWeatherMap API key, follow these steps:

Sign up for an account on OpenWeatherMap and obtain an API key.
